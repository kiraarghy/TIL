# Perf ection üòç

Performance is an area of code that I feel I have neglected. Beyond debugging React hooks and a light understanding of `big O` notation in algorithms, I couldn't really tell you the first thing about performance. Being given the chance to work on the performance of [runpkg](runpkg.com) has been the push I've needed to start caring.

So far I have:

1. implemented a service worker to cache requests to [unpkg](unpkg.com).
2. implemented a web-worker to move a large recursive processing operation off the main thread.
3. dove into the chrome dev tools performance and identified another operation blocking the main thread.

## WebWorker

The webworker was pretty gnarly to make, whilst there is [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) it seems to be pretty sparse on implementation. I looked to [react-hooks-worker](https://github.com/dai-shi/react-hooks-worker) for more implementation details specific to React it was pretty useful but I had some issues e.g. event handlers for `messages`.

I got about 3 hours into this webworker experiment trying to get things going (don't worry I'm an extremely tenacious learner) before I learn that esmodule support is pretty much [non-existent...](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5761300827209728) üò¨. Sorta one of those 'oh-crap, that's why it doesn't work' moments. If you know runpkg, this is Formidable's proof-of-concept for [no-build](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/no-build-step/) JavaScript and as such this lack of support kinda screws it up.

While debugging this lack of esmodule support I went through two possible solutions: 1. produce a package which provided a bundle for this recursive javascript operation, or 2. simply copy and paste the code and convert it to a script, or 3. find some way to bundle an esmodule in the browser (if that's even possible). I'm not proud but I went for the second, more hacky option. I feel this was justified as a large majority of this code was split out to reduce file size and improve readability but largely it required the least work of the three options.

So around 1pm I had a working prototype ü•≥, possibly up to 500ms taken off processing benchmarks, but more importantly freeing up the main thread to do rendering.

## But wait there's a still a problem...

The main thread is still blocked by something else.

But I have a limited amount of time to write on that so you'll have to wait for another day.

I guess the big TILs from today are that no-build doesn't solve everything and working at the edges of the browser can be scary and frustrating.
